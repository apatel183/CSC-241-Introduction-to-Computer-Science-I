# CSC-241-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-I

An introduction to problem solving, algorithms and structured programming using a higher-level programming language. The course was focus on skills for developing algorithms, and for writing and debugging programs. I learn how and when to use loops, conditionals, and functional abstractions in the context of problems motivated by real world applications.
